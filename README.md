# Elevator-Simulator-with-Arduino
The elevator control system built here is a single elevator control system with some basic operations, and these operations can be viewed from external point of view as in how the elevator works from outside. The major circuit components include the buttons (4), LEDs (4), Buzzer and the LCD Display. The four buttons represent the 4 buttons on 4 different floors, and the LEDs represent the current state of the elevator that is in which floor the elevator stands. Buzzer is used for generating a sound while closing of door at each floor and the LCD display is used to display various operations which include closing and opening of the door, the current floor of the elevator, which floor the button is pressed and whether it is moving down or up and a few more.Once the system is initialized a message saying “system initialized” is shown on the LCD display and the elevator stands on the first floor (Assuming there is no ground floor). The various cases through which the system built works are described below.

1.When a button is pressed, the elevator will go to that floor. It may be up or down, once the button is pressed a message “button pressed: x”, x representing the floor will be displayed and then another message “moving up” or “moving down” is displayed on the LCD in accordance with the operation. Once the floor is reached there would be a display of opening and closing of door, and when the door is closing a buzzer sound is generated.

2.When a button is pressed while the door is closing on the same floor the door will stop closing and open again and then gets closed. The operations on the LCD Display and of the buzzer remain same as in the previous case accordingly.

3.When a button is pressed after another button is pressed the lift will stop if the floor is in-between the current floor and destination, if not it will be stored and once the destination is reached the lift would then go back to the floor where the button was pressed later. There is a time limit to press the button that is while passing from one floor to another if a button is pressed in-between floor and has already passed that time limit then the input is stored rather than stopping in between.

Limitations: Here since we have taken only four floors, we have made a system that is capable of storing only one extra floor in the memory and if there are two buttons pressed one after the other then the first one is overwritten by the second one.
